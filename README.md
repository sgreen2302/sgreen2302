- 👋 Hi, I’m Simone (@simonegreen)!
- 👀 I’m interested in cyber threat intelligence, adversary emulation/red teaming, cyber defensive operations, and information ethics/policy.
- 🌱 I’m a current grad student, studying Security Informatics at Johns Hopkins University. I'm a recent grad from Cornell University with a B.S. in Computer Science and minors in Law & Society and Information Ethics, Law, and Policy.
- 💞️ I’m looking to begin personal projects more closely related to security.
- 📫 You can reach me via email at sfg63@cornell.edu :)
