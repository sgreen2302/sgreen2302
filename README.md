- 👋 Hi, I’m Simone (@sgreen2302)!
- 👀 I’m interested in cyber threat intelligence, adversary emulation/red teaming, cyber defensive operations, and information ethics/policy.
- 🌱 I’m currently working on a B.S. in Computer Science at Cornell University with minors in Law & Society and Information Ethics, Law, and Policy.
- 💞️ I’m looking to begin personal projects more closely related to security.
- 📫 You can reach me via email at sfg63@cornell.edu :)
